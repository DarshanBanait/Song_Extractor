# Song_Extractor
Spotify has been the favorite music app for everyone for so long.
But recently, it has moved all its major essential features to spotify premium.
I was frustrated and wanted to switch from spotify to something better, but the issue was I would have to manually search 
all my liked songs on spotify on the other app and then like them to create the exact same liked playlist which I originally 
had on spotify.
To make this easy, I created this song extractor which fetches the names of all the songs from the specified playlist ( of which you provide the playlist_ID)
and writes it to a file.
I am further working to create a script to read songs from this file and search them on other app of your choice and like them just creating the same liked songs playlist 
which was originally created on spotify (for years!!)
Hope you have any use for it :)
